                <p>Hi There! <br>My name is Cristian Demkowicz and I'm a highly motivated aspiring Full Stack Developer with a great passion for UX and Web Design.<br> I'm always looking for new things to learn, with Google as my teacher and code editor
                    as my notebook. Web is my life, exploring web technologies and techniques, developing cool web apps. Anything that can help me in expanding my knowledge is always welcome. <br>My Motto in work (as in my life) is to "Take the impossible,
                    make it obvious" - give me a worthy cause and I'll make it happen.

                </p>

                <h6>IT trainee</h6>
                <p>My journey to GSK was aimed at making a next step in my pursuit of the IT career. I was attracted by meaningful vision and plethora of challanges lying ahead.
                    <br> I’ve joined GSK on may 2018 as a Trainee.
                    <br> My main responsiblity was delivering a gamification platform aimed at AGILE transformation occuring in the company, the project put to use all my so-far learned skills of web-dev and design as well as film making passion.
                    <br><br> I was also assigned to take care of gskit.pl webpage from the perspective of SEO optimization and bug fixing as well as authoring - this has landed me a pretty good understanding of AEM CMS and further enchanced my WEB development
                    skills in huge scale corporate environment.
                    <br><br> Putting my development skills to use I’ve upgraded a corporate office management tool, which helped in optimizing workspace assignment.
                    <br> I also did some improvements and automation regarding a distribution list managament.
                    <br><br> It did not take long for me to engage in the company life:

                <p>My time with ABU coins was the first moment in my life where I could put my web development skills to a good commercial use - helping in managing a huge platform for cryptocurrency exchange.
                    <br><br> My main priority was quality assurance of the web-page which allowed me to learn the arkana of testing web-pages and vast knowledge of block-chain based solutions. This is the time when I put the knowledge of Selenium to a
